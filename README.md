# DocGPT

DocGPT is a machine-learning-based project that takes advantage of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model for document understanding and generation tasks. The repository harnesses the power of GPT to perform tasks such as document summarization, question answering, and other natural language processing operations that can be applied to documents.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into several directories and files. Here is a brief overview of the key components:

- `data/`: This directory should contain any data files needed for the project. It is empty initially and users are expected to add their own datasets for document processing tasks.
- `models/`: This directory is intended to store pre-trained models. Initially, it's empty and users will need to download and place the models into this directory.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use the model for different tasks.
- `scripts/`: This directory includes various scripts for training, evaluating, and using the model. 
- `src/`: Source code directory that contains the implementation of the model and other utility functions necessary to process documents and perform NLP tasks.
- `tests/`: Includes test cases to ensure that the codebase is reliable.
- `.gitignore`: Git configuration file to specify which files or directories should not be tracked by version control.
- `LICENSE`: The license file that outlines the terms under which the software can be used.
- `README.md`: The file which you are currently viewing, containing detailed information about the project.

## Setup and Installation

Before using DocGPT, you must set up your environment. Ensure that you have Python installed and then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are planning to use this repository for deep learning tasks, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment first. This helps in maintaining dependencies separate from your main Python installation.

## Usage

To use DocGPT for your document processing tasks, follow these steps:

1. Place your documents and/or datasets in the `data/` directory.
2. If needed, configure the model and training parameters in the scripts located in the `scripts/` directory.
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to train the model, or use pre-trained models if available.

Example usage can be found within the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, which provide a hands-on approach to understanding how to interact with the GPT model for document-related tasks.

## Contributing

Contributions to the DocGPT project are welcome. If you wish to contribute, you can:

- Report issues and bugs.
- Suggest new features or enhancements.
- Open pull requests with improvements to the codebase or documentation.
