# DocGPT

DocGPT is a codebase designed to use the capabilities of GPT models for generating documentation. This repository allows users to create comprehensive documentation by leveraging the power of generative pre-trained transformers (GPT). Whether you're looking to autogenerate docstrings for your code, create API documentation, or write up technical explanations, DocGPT aims to facilitate these tasks with the help of advanced language models.

## Getting Started

To get started with DocGPT, you will need to clone the repository and set up your environment to run the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terri-yaki/DocGPT.git
cd DocGPT
```

Please make sure you have Python installed on your system and then install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use DocGPT, follow these steps:

1. Import the DocGPT library in your Python script:

```python
from docgpt import DocGPT
```

2. Initialize the DocGPT object with your GPT model of choice:

```python
doc_gpt = DocGPT(model="gpt-model-name")
```

3. Use the provided methods to generate documentation for your code. For example, to generate a docstring:

```python
docstring = doc_gpt.generate_docstring(code_snippet=input_code)
print(docstring)
```

4. For generating API documentation, you can use:

```python
api_docs = doc_gpt.generate_api_docs(api_endpoint_info)
print(api_docs)
```

Replace `input_code` and `api_endpoint_info` with your actual code snippet and API information, respectively.

## Features

- **Docstring Generation**: Automatically generate descriptive docstrings for functions and classes in your code.
- **API Documentation**: Create detailed API documentation that helps other developers understand how to use your API.
- **Technical Documentation**: Generate explanatory text for complex code snippets or algorithms.

## Examples

To quickly see DocGPT in action, you can run the example scripts in the `examples` directory:

```bash
python examples/generate_docstring_example.py
```

This will show you how a docstring can be generated from a sample code snippet.
